Edit to add: I believe the relevant section of the guidelines is: The LEGO Trademarks may be used under certain Limited Circumstances on an Unofficial Web Site
  The LEGO trademarks (but not the logo) may be used in a non-commercial manner to refer to LEGO products or elements which are shown or discussed on a web site, as long as the trademark is not unduly emphasized or used in a way that can lead an observer to mistakenly believe that the site is sponsored or authorized by the LEGO Group. Proper Use of the LEGO Trademark on a Web Site
  If the LEGO trademark is used at all, it should always be used as an adjective, not as a noun. For example, say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGO BRICKS"". Never say ""MODELS BUILT OF LEGOs"".Also, the trademark should appear in the same typeface as the surrounding text and should not be isolated or set apart from the surrounding text. In other words, the trademarks should not be emphasized or highlighted. Finally, the LEGO trademark should always appear with a ® symbol each time it is used. I'm not a lawyer, so can't really summarise it, however in the previous discussion, it was pointed out that we can't really police the community in terms of ""using the LEGO trademark as an adjective rather than a noun"", however where it is used on core parts of the site (FAQ, tags, etc.) then it should be as an adjective, and include the ® symbol.",agur,arabic,arabic.meta

Mindstorms, DUPLO, games, LEGOLand, Bionicle, Modulex, tables, carrying cases, alarm clocks, minifigure collections, company history, BrickMaster and MBA, Znap. The overlap is enormous between people interested in these and the bricks themselves and it's hard to separate them - is a question about a model at LEGOLand a question about bricks, or a question about LEGOLand? It's also important to cover this so the site can serve as a resource for parents (and whether we want it to or not, it probably will this Christmas). Other Bricks. Diablock, Mega Blok, Nanoblock, and undoubtedly a new system every few years. Compatible or not, all brick toys share similar building techniques. In some cases, like Diablock, they are ""not compatible"" as stock pieces but people have built adapters. That means we don't cover K'nex (perhaps shared interest but no shared building techniques), Meccano (in my experience, very little shared interest), and other progressively more marginal building systems. Otherwise I fear we'll see a gradual descent until we cover things that are barely even building toys like Domino Rally, and eventually just be a generic toy site. You might say ""I'm as uninterested in alarm clocks and Znap as I am in K'nex!"" The good news is, the rest of the world agrees with you - the potential number of questions about these things is very small and can never come to dominate the site. That is not true of K'nex. Why is it bad to offer more? Focus. If the site is 90% Lego, we're not going to attract K'nex or Meccano experts. If the site is 30% Lego, we're not going to attract Lego experts.

Since SE doesn't have such a thing as a signature block, I think it might be worth while to establish, early in our coming-out process, our community's relevant tolerance for people pushing either their commercial or non-commercial sites. It feels to me like this has probably been hashed out somewhere else, but what counts is what we want in our community.  I know, for example, Joel S. recently talked about this on a recent SE podcast. I personally feel that ""casual links are ok, but don't be annoying about it"" is a good-enough guideline. There is a tension, in that we obviously don't want the site to be spammy, but also, we don't want to exclude the people that are literally professionals, either.  The people that are expert enough to have their own site will always have a need or desire to associate their awesome answer back to their site.

  if the signals are correlated - that is, where one of them is high, is

  data is generally sparse - that is at most positions both signals are
  zero and this is correct, and also zero-inflated - that is many bases

71,"I felt like if anyone have to learn bioinformatics in the 'proper' way, conceptually; then a base of statistics, data-modelling and computer-programing is a prerequisite. But biology students of most traditional courses; often completely  lack that  basis (such as me is one), and also, bioinformatics is taught directly on masters or equivalent grade (or maybe a little bit introduction in college or bachelor's' grade).   So, how much on topic this site is/ going to be, for such typical bio students who might ask very basic questions about bioinformatics (not expert-like one)?",agur.meta,ai,ai

StackOverflow is full of 'Hello World' questions, and there is nothing wrong with that, so long as the questions are not duplicated.  Once this site has matured, it should hopefully be able to cover even the most basic of bioinformatics questions.

I opening this thread, because one of the most upvoted answers is starting with statement that one should do something else instead of what the question is asking for.  The first statement is not an answer for the question... This is patronising since there is no alternative (""if anything, use FPKMs"" sounds like there is something else than FPKMs to use, no?). I would suggest to keep these comments (that are often very useful) in the END of the answers, not at the beginning. And if we decide to write them, write them with full explanation and a good alternative, not in this declarative style with a link to a blogpost. I really think that this will help keep the community healthy. So is it just me who feel it that way?",3dprinting,avp,beer

I'm going to interpret your post as being, ""I personally believe that the community should offer actual answers before writing opinionated commentary."" Anyway, putting the comment at the beginning there was highly appropriate. OP was essentially saying, ""I'm very new and would like to do something that's almost always a bad idea because I've seen it done in a bunch of papers."" Since OP is new, burying the warning at the end would likely result in OP wasting time by actually making FPKMs and then hopefully reading, ""Oh, but you shouldn't do any of that, do THIS instead.""",bioinformatics,avp,ai
76,"The general position on the SE sites I am active on is that if the OP is using the wrong tool, then that should be the first thing to mention. So, if a question asks something like ""How can I use ClustalW to align two gene sequences?"" I think the first thing to mention is that ClustalW is obsolete and a newer tool like ClustalΩ or any of the various other modern aligners should be used instead. Or if someone asks how to use BLAST to call variants from an NGS dataset, rather than attempting to find some sort of weird hack that would make that possible, we should instead point out that there are far, far better tools for this.  So no, if I feel the OP is barking up the wrong tree, pointing that out and providing an alternative seems like the best way of starting an answer. Why waste time explaining the wrong tool instead of helping the OP choose the right one? If it's just a question of opinion then yes, that should go at the end or not at all. But if it is a case of an XY problem or simple ignorance on the part of the OP, then pointing out the essential error in their reasoning is probably the most useful thing the answer can do. ",arabic.meta,agur,agur
77,"Here's my take on each of the points you raise: Unfriendly community, questions are received with down-votes I know many people feel this way but my experience in the SE network has been the exact opposite. Downvotes are not bad. Let me repeat that. Downvotes are not bad. They are in fact precisely what makes the SE sites so useful. We need bad posts to be downvoted, that's the only way good posts come to the top. yes, some people can take the downvotes as an insult instead of as an invitation to improve their answer. Quite simply, those people won't have a good time here so it would be better for them—and us—if they go to another site.That's not a problem, there's enough to go around.  Toxic environment That really isn't my impression of SE and I feel that most people who feel it's toxic simply don't understand the system and consider downvotes and closed questions to be personal attacks. With the possible exception of SO which is orders of magnitude larger than any other site, most SE sites are relatively friendly as long as you put some effort into your posts. Yes, dumping your homework with no attempt to solve it and asking others to do your work for you are not well received. Well, they shouldn't be.  However, I have been quite active (>10 or 20k rep) on 4 sites of the network, I'm an elected mod on two and participate in quite a few more. I haven't felt any of them were in any way ""toxic"". Maybe I was lucky, granted, but I really think the ""toxicity"" is almost entirely born of simple misunderstandings about what the SE site are and are not.  Lack of support from moderators I don't really know what that is supposed to mean. I see some complaints about too much moderation in the linked biostars post but none of a lack thereof. Also, most people who're not familiar with SE tend to assume that anyone who cotes to close a post or edits or does anything else that wouldn't be possible by users on traditional forums is a mod.  Lack of discussion about questions Yes, absolutely! SE is not a forum and not the right place for disussion. But that's great! If you need a discussion, you can always go to Biostars or SeqAnswers or even our chat. This isn't a place for discussion, it's a Q&A site. That's fine: to each their own.   Adding more sites is diluting the user base Dunno about that. I, for example, find both SeqAnswers and Biostars unpleasant, chaotic and far harder to extract useful information out of than the SE sites. Which is why I am so pleased with this proposal. So it's not so much a question of diluting the community as it is one of offering multiple venues where each of us can find their niche and the site they find most useful. There are enough bioinformaticians around by now that the community can support multiple sites, I think.  Cross-post with other communities Why does this matter? If another community has a useful piece of information, we copy it over. That's the beauty of open licenses.  License of the code provided in Stack Exchange Again, for me that's a feature and not a bug. Any code posted here can be used by anyone else in the community with attribution. Surely that's a good thing? In summary, there's no reason to please everyone. This is an SE site and the SE network has clearly demonstrated that there are many, many users who enjoy their system and find it useful in their work. Other people find it too restrictive or negative or hard to deal with. That's absolutely fine. Those of us who like the SE system are free to use this site and those of us who don't are free to use the others. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.  So yes, we should be friendly and open and helpful to newbies. Ignorance is never a sin. On the other hand, laziness and unwillingness to put effort into your question and answer are, and I see no reason why we shouldn't have strict quality standards. Many SE sites cater to both experts and novices and the level of expertise is far less important than the effort put into a post. So as long as you don't use this site as a substitute for doing your own work, you should be welcome to ask a question of any level of expertise here. But not things that would be answered by pasting the question title into Google or Wikipedia. Some effort is required, yes.",agur,agur,bioinformatics
78,"I also don't think that ""What is the best foo"" can ever be a good question. I would instead suggest something like: Is there a comprehensive review and benchmark of the various tools for FOO? What tools had the best results? Something like that can be answered by citing a specific review paper and the measurements there. In any case, the ""best"" usually depends on what you're doing. For example, while toolA might be the best for computing expression in speciesA or tissueA, toolB might fare better in another species/tissue.  So no, let's not allow ""what is the best foo"" questions, but instead try and make them as specific as possible while still being general enough to be worth asking.",agur.meta,arabic,agur

I think bioinformatics SE should be a bit different: A place to go to find if other professionals have come across and solved similar problems to the one you are having.

In fact, I’m usually even stricter: in this particular case there was no harm in also providing a literal answer (i.e. the code that implements FPKMs) but usually I would outright refuse to answer a misguided question, and only focus on alternatives. The first statement is not an answer for the question...

82,"How do we feel about questions about biological principles that can be confusing to a bioinformatician with no background in biology? While purely biological questions should, I think, be off topic and migrated to Biology, what about questions from bioinformaticians trying to interpret their results? For example, if someone were to ask about what these weird 0/1 things they see in a VCF file, should we explain what haplotypes and zygosity are? If someone asks about how a PPI network is generated, should we explain ChIP or Y2H methods here?  Basically, how strict is our definition of bioinformatics? This is a subfield of biology, after all.",3dprinting,ai,3dprinting
83,"I think we should indeed explain biological concepts as long as those are clearly relevant to the work of a bioinformatician. So, a general question about transcription should be off topic, but a question about the biological interpretation of computational data (blast output, for example) should be allowed.  A simple example would be a question about interpreting a sequence alignment. While it may look like bioinformatics, it is very hard to interpret such alignments usefully without some basic knowledge about the biological concepts of sequence evolution, the chemical properties of amino acids, protein domains, exons, introns etc. So a good answer would have to include at least some ""pure"" biology. I think it will be very hard to set out specific guidelines for this so early in the site's life, but perhaps this is something to bear in mind going forward. I expect that in the following weeks we will start getting such borderline questions and I hope we can get to a consensus about them using real examples.  In the meantime, I propose that as a rule of thumb, we should allow any questions that arise from bioinformatic analyses. If it turns out those are too permissive and too ""wet"", we can reassess.

This positive reinforcement (combined with the requirement that I do more work) allowed me to learn how to ask better questions without getting discouraged. I often think that the bad reputation that SO has among many people is that their first experience(s) asking questions were treated rudely or just downvoted with no explanation. So I'm wondering if we should have some standard language people can use for some common question faux pas. I was prompted to ask by Iakov Davydov's response to this question, which I think is a good start. Friendly but clear on what additional steps should be taken. So the actual question: should we have a bank of standard responses?

88,"I think this is a little bit the wrong question, it should be ""Is there a large enough community to support two almost identical sites."" The core of the problem is that there is a community already on biostars and in principle all the users you want are already here: https://www.biostars.org/user/list/?sort=reputation&limit=all%20time&q= Some have predicted that this beta might not work, simply because there is already this established site, and I mostly agree with them. Bioinformatics is a scientific field with a growing but limited audience compared to other topics like programming. In my opinion, it is unlikely that there exists a large potential scientific community that is so far put off by the technical limitations and other shortcomings that surely BioStars.org has, and that is also able and willing to invest time into QA. In other words, the people who are available are most likely already engaged, and for most of the other scientist the tiny differences are marginal compared to large scientific problems of interest.       To make people transition to the SE brand, you needed to offer them some added value. Indeed the SE technology is superior, but that is not good enough. Certainly BioStars has a superior user base from interested beginner to PhD students to senior researchers and professors, with enthusiasm and experience in Q&A. That knowledge base will certainly attract more questions because there is a much better chance to get a competent answer. Just to add some figures, on biostars, there were >300 posts this week, and >60 today, from a total of 35,000 users.

More relevant would be the rate of questions having an accepted answer, though. Small communities have merits. I think that if the activity is too intense, it gets sometimes difficult to have one's question answered, because questions get easily swamped in the flow of questions. So far, with a few questions per day, I'm able to read all question titles: I won't miss a question I could answer or that could be interesting for me.

90,"I don't think we're getting a good representation of questioners among the people who are able to participate in the private beta. Bioinformatics is too broad for a small private beta to work well. You're asking for more users among the people who have already committed to participate in the site, which is only a bit over 200. 100 of those users have a high profile in other sites (at least, but pretty close to 100), which means that current users are more likely to be answerers than questioners. It feels fake for me to ask questions that I already know the answer to, and yet the questions that are most often asked on bioinformatics forums (and most useful to bioinformaticians) are the ones that are frequently established knowledge in a different area. For the questions that I do have, it's unlikely that a large number of other committed bioinformaticians have the precise specialisation required to provide useful answers. I could perhaps take some questions from BioStars, SeqAnswers, and the nanopore community forums, but that does not feel like the ethically-correct thing to do.

Unlike other Beta SE sites, there are already large, competing Bioinformatics Q&A sites on the internet1, so unlike for other sites people won’t go out of their way to subscribe to a private site here. There’s simply not enough demand. Now, I’ll be the first to say that the competing Q&A sites are very unsatisfactory for various reasons. But they exist, and they represent large parts of the professional bioinformatics community. A private Bioinf.SE isn’t an attractive competition. In order to become attractive it has to offer more than the competition, not less. This means: open the site, and implement crucial, missing usability features. Robert, you’ve been in this business a while, you know how communities work. So I’m honestly surprised that this comes as a shock to anybody at Stack Exchange. It’s worth noting that Stack Exchange should have a vested commercial interest in successful communities. And while I appreciate the extent to which commercial interests have taken a backseat to community building at Stack Exchange, maybe it’s worth considering the pros of giving some support to a Bioinformatics.SE community. 1 I count at least four: Biostars, Bioconductor Support, /r/bioinformatics (etc), and SEQanswers.",arabic.meta,3dprinting,bioinformatics

94,"I have been thinking about this for a while. This recently on-hold question really touches my nerve. The question is put on hold due to being too ""broad"". I will use it as an example to explain my concerns. First, ""broad"" (as well as ""off-topic"" etc) is subjective. In this particular case, I think the question is on the border line at best. I certainly would not vote to close it, even though I am actually quite picky. To most new NGS users, they would think this is a fine question, too. Second, even if ""broad"", this question is interesting and useful. It has attracted 4 upvotes in 13 hours, which is relatively fast in this new SE. The answer tells me something new and equally interesting. It has got 5 upvotes, too. Third, broad questions may inspire epic answers. For this question, someone familiar with QC might take the chance to give a succinct but comprehensive review of existing QC tools and measurements, something you occasionally see at SO or other SE sites. This would be invaluable to everyone. You can't get such an answer from a specific question on a particular technical problem with a QC tool. Fourth, at this particular time we are struggling to pass the private beta phase, I speculate that closed questions are not counted. @RobertCartaino said we had less than 75 questions a couple of days ago. However, as @gringer pointed out, we had 77 questions almost at the same time. In addition, on the question page, we have 102 questions right now, but on the Area51 page, we only have (15+1)*4.9=78.4 questions. Why the difference? Finally, even if not just for private beta, we need both experts AND new users to keep this site alive. To me, the questions here are a little too ""narrow"". They focus too much on specific technical issues. Questions slightly deviating from this focus quickly got downvoted or closed. Note that we are competing with BioStar. Although criticized for all the problems, its broadness and friendliness to newcomers are undeniable. If we keep closing border-line questions so aggressively, we would push new users to biostar and finally kill this SE, again. So, please refrain from closing proper but imperfect questions so quickly. EDIT: here is a list of questions that are currently closed or put on hold. Influential papers. I wouldn't vote to close it, but I can understand why others want. Bioinformatics vs biostatistics vs computational biology. Hmm... same comment as above. Stable download URL. A little general, but I think it touches a real problem. I have voted to reopen it. QC for NGS. This is the question I was mentioning at the beginning. It is a proper question. Smalt. This is a good bioinformatics question and should not get closed. Public multi-omics dataset. This is a good and relevant question. Many newcomers will have the same question. The answer has got 6 upvotes. Constructing gene network. I am not familiar with the topic enough to tell. NGS metadata schema. OP was essentially asking what relationships are common to general schemas. This is a proper question and should not be closed. Even if there were no general solutions, this would not make the question itself non-specific. Scripting parallel processing. Closed due to off-topic. I don't think it is bad enough to merit a closure. @DevonRyan's answer is informative. Note that OP is a highly experienced SO user. He/she did not show up after this question. On bootstrapping. Closed due to off-topic. OP has really put a lot of efforts into the question. The answers are good, too. I don't think it is that off-topic, either. We use bootstrapping often. Again, we pushed a potential new user away. Genome vs transcriptome. Closed due to off-topic. New bioinformatics students with a CS background are likely to have the same question. I don't see we should close it. Again, OP was asking only one question and then gone. Difference between common formats. Closed due to too general.

145,"This has been answered in a couple of places, namely in a comment, but I'll go ahead and give it a go. Mission  Homebrew has a pretty specific mission and vision. To support home brewers in the brewing of their own beer. To do that they do take on a variety of topics around the beer industry, tasting, ingredients etc. However, the scope of this site is broader and more expansive. It includes large scale production, excludes super small scale production and generally is more focused on the consumption of beer rather than production. Audience This is where the real differences lie. While there is likely a good bit of audience overlap (probably all homebrewers are beer drinkers), Home brewers are a subset of all beer drinkers. This site is intended to appeal to the superset of beer drinkers. Conclusion The only real issue here is the ordering of the site's beginnings. Typically how site parentage would work would be that the larger audience site would be the first, and then the separate interest group would splinter. In this case the separate interest group already has their own site with their own question set. There are a couple of interesting questions here on meta that address this further:  Is Homebrewing on topic? What should we do when a question already has an answer on the Homebrewing site? And lastly, I'd like to point back to an instance where I had many of the same thoughts I've seen re: homebrewing with another set of sites that I was involved in. The Sport.SE/Fitness.se meta crisis. Shog set me straight here, and I've come to see his way of thinking about these things.

I will be evaluating the private beta of ""Beer SE"" soon, and this is what has become evident to me as I watch this site develop: My Beer SE Evaluation The cross-cultural interests between ""Homebrew SE"" and ""Beer SE"" have way more overlap than I would have anticipated. I am not typically an advocate for combining producers and end users, but in this case, there is simply too much overlap of interests — not necessarily physical audiences, but interests — to ignore. Hypothetically, if we were to remove the ""brewing-related questions"" from Beer SE (I'm not suggesting that), this site would become one big snooze fest fast. After I figure out what temperature to keep my beer… and how to keep it going skunky, just about the only interesting questions left are those that DO veer into what goes behind the brewing process. The deeper ""consumers"" here are asking about the ""artisanship""… and that's the best part of this site. It makes sense, really. When there's a fervent appreciation for a subject (at least food/drink space), the more-engaged experts almost have to delve behind the scenes to study what separates good brews from bad; to understand the parameters that go into what they're ""appreciating.""  You don't have to be a literal ""brewer/craftsman"" to have an implicit interest in the subject. Many of the beer enthusiasts here are curious about the craft — you almost have to, to appreciate the subject — and that's why they are asking about it here. And of course the craftsmen need to know what makes a good beer … so there's a lot of cross-cultural interests here, whether you an actual, literal ""home brewer"" not.  It simply makes sense to combine these subjects. While the brewers and consumers are not physically the same exact audience, they do largely seem to have the same range of interests… and questions.

Visually, there is nothing to distinguish the hamzat al-waṣl in any of these cases; they are written exactly the same.

221,"It is true that in historical textual witnesses many words were written without dots (or were only incompletely equipped with dots). In fact, some materials are (almost entirely) devoid of dots at all. What we get in these manuscripts and testimonies is the bare rasm, i.e., the skeleton of the word, like كىٮ , which could be kuntu or kataba, and so on. In many cases, there will be no problem for a learned scribe or reader to understand the text, as the context will usually provide enough pieces of information for what the words could (or should) be. This being said, it is clear that there is a certain (sometimes even high) degree of ambiguity that arises from missing dots. So, scribes often added at least some dots (but not all of them) to disambiguate more sufficiently. Here is an example (probably 7th/13th century):
 Nowadays, scholars working with historical texts nonetheless have a lot to do in finding out how the dotless words should properly be interpreted. This is due to the fact that they are a couple of hundred years removed from the environment of the text which they investigate and are not fully familiar with the habits and customs of, say, an Egyptian scribe of rural documents in the 9th century or with the layout of petitions from the Mamlūk period. The more information scholars can collect of these customs and habits the more securely can they interpret those texts, i.e. the more one knows about the context the easier can one read the text. Other than that, it should be added that even with all dots supplied, there are ambiguous cases, as some word patterns are identical, e.g. the active or passive voice of most participles (مفعل could be mufaʿʿil vs. mufaʿʿal or even mufʿil or mufʿal), or a imperfect verb in the the first stem (بفعل : yafʿalu) could also be a verb in the second stem (yufaʿʿilu) or fourth stem (yufʿilu), or even the passive voice of these (i.e., yufʿalu or yufaʿʿalu or again yufʿalu, respectively).

227,"At the beginning of speech, i.e. at the beginning of a new sentence or clause or any position that is preceded by a grammatical pause, the hamzat al-waṣl or alif al-waṣl is pronounced according to the following rules: The article al- always takes ""a"". Verbs of the VII. (infaʿala), VIII. (iftaʿala, IX. (ifʿalla) and X. stem (istafʿala) (as well as the XI., XII., XIII., XIV., and XV., which are extremely rare) have the alif al-waṣl of their perfect/past stem pronounced as ""i"". Verbs in the imperative mood have their alif al-waṣl pronounced as either ""i"" or ""u"". As for nouns, they also usually take ""i"" (as ibn or ism). It is important to note that the alif al-waṣl is also not written in some cases, e.g. when the word is preceded by the prepositions bi- or li- or the particle la- (as for example in بسم الله : bi-smi llāhi). Generally speaking, the reason for prefixing a hamzat al-waṣl or alif al-waṣl to a word is that the Arabic language avoids the existence of two consonant at the beginning of a word. Since verbs like infaʿala or nouns like ibn and imperatives like uḫruǧ would -- without an alif al-waṣl -- begin with two consonants, one is orthographically required to add a vowel. This vowel, then, is pronounced only if the word in question is alone in isolation or at the beginning of a sentence or after a grammatical pause. There may be other words which take on a vowel for the same reason, i.e. to avoid two consonants at the beginning of the word, but they keep it under any circumstances. Such words are, for example, often loanwords from other languages (e.g. Greek), which may take ""a"" (as in aflāṭūn : ""Plato"") or ""u"" (as in usṭuquss : ""element/letter""). This, then, is called hamzat al-qaṭʿ. In your example from al-Fātiḥā, the word in question (ihdinā  : ""guide us!"") is an imperative from the verb hadā/yahdī. Since it contains ""i"" in its present tense, it takes ""i"" in its imperative.",ai,arabic,arabic

An example of a word that uses a Alif ending is: مرحباً ""Marhaban"" Which in this case is because of a particular rule in relation to the ""a"" ending on Marhaba.

Similar forms such as qabl-u ‘before’, fawq-u ‘above,’ and taHt-u ‘beneath’ also exist, with the restriction that they may not occur as the first term of an ʾiDaafa. On this topic see also Fleisch 1961, I:280, and Chapter 16, section 3.4.3. Following up the reference to Chapter 16, there is another interesting footnote: 13 The final Damma on baʿd-u and on certain other semi-prepositions (qabl-u, taHt-u) is considered to be a remnant of an old locative case. This Damma has two characteristics: (1) it is invariable, even after a preposition (e.g., min qabl-u; min taHt-u); (2) it cannot be on the first term of an ʾiDaafa, that is, it cannot be followed by a noun in the genitive case or by a pronoun suffix. See chapter 11, section 4.1.3, especially note 12. This suggests that the -u ending is a remnant of what used to be another case in proto-Semitic, but by Qur'anic times was only visible in a few words that behave differently to what you expect.

This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).

For native speakers, the regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today.  For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country). This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions.  But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine.  (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.) One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.  These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences.  So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).",arabic.meta,arabic.meta,arabic.meta

Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history.

Cutting dialects out of the scope would likely cut out a significant majority of our potential activity. For the second case, however, I feel that there's value in establishing some clear guidelines to prevent the site from just becoming a mish-mash of dialects. I would suggest the following: Consider English and Fusha as the ""official"" languages of this site Allow questions on the main page in regional dialects, but only if they're expressly about some aspect of that dialect, and tagged appropriately. In short, the only time a dialect should be used is if it… Otherwise, either Fusha or English should be used.

As such this is not a question of ""if"" but ""how"". On the proposal we hinted that classical (Fusha) Arabic was the default dialect of all questions/answers and I see no reason to change that. However, the big question, of which some of these answers try to solve, is how to deal with dialects when they do arise. Having read @GoldPseudo's answer it seems he knows what he is on about and his ideas seem sound.  It makes sense that if someone asks in English it is likely that they are a student or learner of Arabic, as such the answers should probably be English as well. Likewise, if the question is in Arabic there is no use writing in a totally different language (English) since that person is speaking Arabic, and this is Arabic SE after-all. We should probably encourage this stance and punish those who do not follow it with downvotes to try and create some norm, else I can see this quickly becoming a mess. We should also allocate tags for dialects as suggested. We need to be more careful about this last point though and I am still unclear exactly how we should structure this.

I can understand the appeal for Buckwalter from a linguistic point of view — not only does it clearly and reversibly map to the Arabic alphabet, but it does so with standard characters — but it also has the annoying side-effect of being difficult to actually just read.

Along with the lack of guidance, not requiring wiki-text when creating new tags leads to a proliferation of separate tags where tag-synonyms might be more appropriate (article, arabic-the, al). There should be cases where one tag is used and another is not, whereas arabic-the and al would always be together since they refer to the exact same thing. Just as new questions are moderated, new tags should be moderated. Each tag should have a tag-wiki which justifies its existence and distinguishes its use from existing tags. If these requirements cannot be met, then the new tag should be removed from the list of available tags.",ai,avp,ai

299,"As goldPseudo noted in the comments above, Too Localized was removed as a close reason back in 2013: Too Localized was, by far, the most misused close reason in our surveys, with both Community Managers and Moderators deeming over 50% of randomly sampled TL closures to not have merited closure (including on SO). Today, TL is used helpfully on code dump questions on SO, but the new OT reasons are where this is now correctly addressed. SO can use ""Large blocks of code with requests for debugging without meaningful supporting info"" as a specific OT reason. So what does this mean for Arabic? Well, with enough consensus, the community could add a custom off-topic close reason for cases like these. But in the meantime it's important to think through why a ""too localized"" question is actually bad for Arabic Language SE.  One result of ""too localized"" being removed as a network-wide close reason is that communities are now better able to decide for themselves that constitutes a useful question. On a language site like Arabic, many questions would qualify as what used to be ""too localized"" on Stack Overflow. They answer one person's question, but they don't always solve a common problem people have when writing or speaking Arabic that they'll end up searching for. And yet, we still find such questions (examples: 1, 2) valuable1 as we build a compendium of knowledge about Arabic--and a community of knowledgeable people who like learning and teaching about Arabic concepts and history.

It may be that it is not appropriate to ask such a question here; I know during the 51 phase there was a question regarding questions in English and a desire at least among some users to keep them limited to truly sincere students of the language – and sadly, I do not have the time to be that. The answers to this question suggested to me that this site is really primarily for people who already speak Arabic, not for teaching English speakers (that is, that the site is the Arabic analogue of the English Language & Usage site, not the English Language Learners site). On the other hand, the existing meta question on the subject does suggest that it is open to all levels, the analogue of ELL as well as EL&U.

The recent advances in artificial intelligence, like  Alpha Go, have been the result of breakthroughs in implementation.

I think all the scientists working on AI would be helpful here even though we're not working on implementation. This is what the original Area 51 Discussion post said (excerpted): Data Science is an applied site for all the programmers/statisticians/mathematicians who are trying to make this stuff work. There's some leeway there. Specifically, technical questions seem to be OK, as long as they're not super in depth about the math or programming. There are also ""why"" questions (as opposed to ""how"") that are very interesting and educational. I like this question a lot. Scientists are welcome.

357,"First there is a need to distinguish modeling from implementation. They are not exactly the same, although strongly related. This was a very difficult lesson to learn among mathematicians and early programmers, notably in the 70s (mathematical proofs can demand a lot of non-trivial programming work to make them ""computable"", as in runnable on a computer). As for Machine Learning (by far the most active AI category), modeling belongs to Data Science SE---perhaps the one thing that most people agree on. Implementation should be out of there, as the issues and focus differ (but again, they are related). Now, should implementation issues be in AI SE, or StackOverflow? The recurring example is TensorFlow, who's home page states that questions should go to StackOverflow. And we should respect that... But we should keep in mind that the TensorFlow team will choose SO, because it is the largest community, and because the team has something else to do rather than experimenting with hardly visible communities. Well, size matters. We may think that if AI SE becomes big enough on the implementation side, the TensorFlow team (and other major frameworks) may move actually. In fact, I think now that implementation questions would benefit from a dedicated site (my view has evolved since the Area 51 definition phase). I have replied and tried to reply to several SO questions related to ML tools, and I think some are out of place compared to other questions. For example, some TensorFlow questions are not really programming questions, and not really framework questions. I mean, there is background knowledge on graph construction and execution, as well as background knowledge about statistics and probabilities that are really necessary to make meaningful contributions. This is not to say that all questions are out of place on SO. Some are really framework issues or (Python) programming issues, and they are good there. Based on this opinion, I think the site should be interested in implementation experts, whether they work on ML or Expert Systems (or both?).

358,"I'm seeing a lot of answers from people along the lines of ""AI is just bits and bytes and ultimately cannot be smarter than its creator because its creator would have to use their brain to make something smarter than themselves, which isn't possible."" I think this argument is a bit unclear and needs some refinement. It is true that AI can indeed be smarter than the creator at certain tasks (AlphaGo being better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, for instance). What I think this argument is really saying is: ""AI is just bits and bytes programmed by its creator. The creator would be able to know how the AI works, otherwise he would be unable to create it in the first place. Therefore, the creator can be said to be superior to that of its creation, since the creator can understand its creation."" That seems like a more logical premise. Sure, AlphaGo is better at Go than the programmers of AlphaGo, but AlphaGo's programmers actually knows how AlphaGo operates. This type of argument was made in the paper Creativity, the Turing Test, and the (better) Lovelace Test, which specifically argues that  AIs cannot be creative since programmers are able to figure out what their creations (AIs) are doing. Another paper ""The Lovelace 2.0 Test of Artificial Creativity and Intelligence"" saw this argument as so self-evidently true that it tried to create a weaker version of the Lovelace Test to identify and measure AI creativity. The programmers, basically, know how their program works. That doesn't mean the program is less intelligent than the programmers. Just that the programmers can understand why their programs behave the way they do, given enough time and patience.

371,"The final fallback for market resolution (after all reporters have reported on an event and someone still believes the answer is wrong) is called Fork Resolution.  Only one fork can be active at a time per branch (in Augur, a branch is akin to an entire universe that is isolated from other universes).  Once a fork starts, all other markets that are awaiting reporter based resolution (this does not include automated reporting) are delayed until the fork resolves.  Once the fork resolves, all of those pending markets will migrate to the branch (universe) that won the fork. The fact that existing markets migrate to a particular world view is one of the first differences with AgnosticPM.  In AgnosticPM, the universe a market lives in is based entirely on markets that came before.  In Augur, while a market is created within a particular universe (branch), it will migrate forward to another branch if a fork occurs before the market settles.  The reason for this is because if a fork occurs, we must assume that reporters have been compromised and any reporting they do is invalid.  It is also assumed that the fork resolution process is the best answer we have to ""who was right"". As for how the fork resolution process actually works, its pretty simple.  Before the fork, there is REP (tokens) that is associated with a particular branch (universe).  This REP is traded on exchanges and has some market value.  When a fork occurs, a new branch is created (conceptually) for every possible outcome and each branch has a new REP token.  Anyone who holds the original REP token can convert (1:1 ratio) their token to a REP token on any branch of the fork.  The act of converting your REP from the parent branch to a child is how you vote for which branch you think represents reality.  Once you have cast your vote, there is no going back so be certain! At the end of the fork (currently ~2 months) whichever branch had the most REP migrated to it is considered the winner and all existing markets needing reporting will migrate to that branch, and share tokens for the forking market will be redeemed using the outcome from that branch. This begs the question, why would I risk my REP casting a vote instead of just keeping my original REP?  The answer to this is that no new markets can be created on the original branch and all existing markets will resolve on the winning branch.  This means that REP on the original branch will yield no reporting fees to REP holders as there will be no markets to report on.  As a REP holder, your job is to pick the branch that you think the most future fees will come from.  This means you want to pick the branch that has the most market participation (volume/outstanding interest) so your REP gets the maximum amount of fees long term.  In almost all cases, this will be the branch that represents the truth/reality.  The only cases where this is less certain are forks that are highly contentious, where not everyone agrees on what reality even means. In order to incentivize people to migrate their REP during the voting period (tentatively 2 months), there will likely be some small inflation assigned to everyone who migrates sooner rather than later (e.g., 5%).  The idea here is that if you pick a side (rather than abstaining) then your share of REP will not be diluted.  If you abstain, then your share of REP will be diluted by some amount relative to how many people migrate.  The goal here is to make it so abstaining from the vote is a losing strategy in almost all cases (non-contentious forks) as this increases the cost of mounting a forking attack against Augur. Regarding AgnosticPM, Augur is similar in that it has a concept of branches (universes) which have a history of truths associated with them.  The primary difference between Augur and AgnosticPM is that Augur has a concept of finality, meaning that the system has the ability to assert that a particular outcome is an absolute truth for the sake of paying out winnings.  In AgnosticPM, there is no way to extract deposited ETH from the system, its ETH-in-only.  This is a pretty huge difference as it means that AgnosticPM, while fun and possibly effective, doesn't have a way of liquidating its ETH holdings back to participants to payout.  As long as AgnosticPM experiences heavy growth, this may not be a problem but if it ever ceases to experience usage growth then this becomes a big problem.  Investors know this, which will likely make them hesitant to buy any AgnosticPM share tokens, which is likely to drive their value to below 1 ETH (their target).",agur,agur,agur

393,"The parasite problem is as of yet unsolved.  Internally, the Augur team has referred to it as the problem of derivative financial markets.  The short version of the problem is that in order for REP to remain secure, the system needs to know the total value at risk so it can accurately assess how valuable REP must be in order to effectively secure that much value at risk.  If enough people have assets attached to Augur indirectly (in a way that Augur doesn't know how to account for) such that the cost of launching an attack against REP is less than the profit to be made from such an attack then the security model has broken down. As the link you provided suggests, this is an as-of-yet unsolved problem.  The tentative plan is to move forward with recognition of this problem and closely monitor the system at launch.  If Augur is wildly successful, then it is possible that its internal volume will outpace derived volume.  In that case, we (the community) merely need to watch from the outside and pay attention to how much value is at risk in derivative markets.  If derivative markets start to surpass Augur's internal volume, then the first step is to approach the authors of the derivatives markets (off-chain, human interaction) and see if they would be willing to hook in to Augur's Oracle system more closely (and pay fees, which are presumed to likely be very low).  The reason one may choose to do this is because if they are dependent on Augur as an Oracle and the Oracle fails, they fail as well.  0.01% trading fee (or whatever it is) may be well worth it to someone who is big enough to be a risk to Augur's security model if it helps ensure their system remains secure. For smaller fish, who may be less interested in ""contributing their fair share"" to system security, as long as Augur and big fish derivative markets are paying their fair share then the system is designed to handle a bit off lossiness in the value at risk calculations. The real problem arrives if you have an actor that not only is wildly successful and dependent on Augur's Oracle, but is also unwilling to pay for the security costs that lead to their success.  In general, such an actor needs to either be uninformed as to the risk they are taking or not financially motivated.  At the moment, we aren't terribly worried about such actors in the ecosystem, and initially the Ethereum ecosystem is small enough that we can likely run a successful smear campaign against such an actor. Generally speaking, Augur does want derivative markets (and other interesting things) built on top of the Augur Oracle.  As long as people doing this recognize that security isn't free, it is possible (likely?) that they will be willing to contribute the very small cost associated with maintaining enough security to cover their own security costs.",agur,agur,ai
394,"Does the potential profit come from the efforts of a promoter or third party?
  Potentially yes as the REP holders cannot earn a profit without the efforts of the market creators. I believe this is where it fails.  REP holders only make money if they report on markets.  As an incentive for reporting on markets, REP holders are paid for their trouble and for the security the provide to the system.  Someone who just buys REP and sits around doing nothing will earn no fees. By buying REP you are not only locking up an asset as part of participation in a crypto-economic security system (which the Howey Test and SEC don't really understand, so who knows how they will view it) but you are also effectively registering to participate in the reporting system (which is how you get fees).

During the appeal period the consensus outcome can be contested by anyone willing to post a contesting bond. Each time a consensus is appealed, a new consensus is obtained from a more reliable and more expensive source. The first appeal increases the number of reporters to every single reporter. The second appeal ignores reporters and instead determines consensus using market forces.

Get a good, balanced, secure scope in place first, then try to include recommendation questions if you still want them.",arabic,arabic.meta,arabic
470,"Sites get a customized design when they near graduation and that is a long way off. The task at hand is to gather up a collection of high quality questions so this site can get out of Private Beta. Focus on that now. When the site is nearing graduation, the designers will contact you for feedback on a potential design. Typically the design is created by the designers first and it is posted for feedback and suggestions. The process of when and how this happens has been in flux more recently, but typically a logo contest is not really part of that process. But who knows… I've been floating various suggestions about how to get the community looped back in that process. ",agur,3dprinting,bricks
471,"Typically, it's a better idea to wait before you try to get this kind of thing integrated. Enthusiasm is great in a private beta, but for the early stages, direct that enthusiasm towards the Q&A. That's what'll get this site on its feet and into a successful public beta. When the site's more stable and running nicely, then if there's a need (or want) for a plugin like this then the discussion about it can be had. (On a tangent - if such a plugin is going to happen, it may well be down to SE's developers to get it done, which might make getting assistance from the people on this site difficult.)",ai,avp,3dprinting
472,"This has inspired some discussion and I may be just splitting hairs, but I've always been confused by this strategy.  The specific example I'm referring to is here: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60 In many cases on SE, I see people post ""Answers"" that basically say ""Don't do what you're doing.  Instead you can get to your goal by doing this.""  While it is often helpful, this form of answer is the bane of my existence as a user of SE sites. There are often cases when I am googling a difficult problem because I cannot do ""alternative a"" as suggested by the answerer.  Then, I get to an SE question that asked about exactly the situation I am having.  An answer of ""Don't do that, do this instead"" is upvoted, accepted, and the only answer.  Thus, I am unable to solve my problem using SE.  In other words, the Answer didn't apply to the question, and so SE led me down the wrong path. Am I doing something wrong here?  Is this an expected/accepted pattern?  Or is this something I should go the route of downvoting?  Or like the poster of the above answer suggests, flagging?",agur.meta,avp,ai
473,"A big shout out to all of us for a successful graduation into private beta. 
Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly. This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) post on meta.hermeneutics.SE; I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular Question Votes make the site look more active. I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is absolutely critical to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.   Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community. If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post Asking Better Questions might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, How to Ask directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource. Finally, I want to reiterate that Voting on questions  is free!  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:) Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.   You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up! To show that this is true, they've even created a badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship""). If you think an answer is useful, vote it up.  If you think an answer is not useful, vote it down.  Either way, vote! If you need help on writing answers, the meta post How do I write a good answer to a question? will help you out. If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site. To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: Vote Early, Vote Often Quoting RobertCartaino from chat: Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know. Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.              []",agur,avp,ai

""Easy"" isn't defined. If you have an ""easy"" question, but it is specific, high-quality, and to the point, and you can show some effort in it, then, please, go ahead and ask it!

484,"Stack Exchange works hard for its communities, but there is a limit. If thingiverse changes its API (which it can, and does, do at any time without notice) then anything we build on it has to be modified, and users will be very whiny until it's fixed. If we choose to integrate model viewing or any sort of API integration with an outside service, we will have to make sure the service provides some sort of legacy guarantee minimal API that won't change, and then we will only be able to use that.   I would be very uncomfortable endorsing a closed source, commercial service on this site.  There are many communities within the world of 3D printing that are very unhappy with makerbot, thingiverse, and their parent company, and encouraging users to use this service may result in pushing away some very valuable experts within the reprap world. If we integrate any sort of model library or model viewer, I strongly suggest we choose an open source project the community can heartily endorse.  We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject. This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.  It may be that thingiverse objects are linked to frequently, and that it would add value to the site to improve that experience, but it's also just as likely that thingiverse turns out to be infrequently linked and the effort spent now would essentially have been wasted.  Let's wait until we have tens of thousands of questions so we can properly evaluate what the community actually uses and needs.",agur,arabic,3dprinting

486,"The ultimate goal of any answer should be to solve the problem that the asker is facing. Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't think about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that ""I must solve it this way"" and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside.  That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit. It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is part of the problem. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it. Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like ""It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just happens to be an alternative"", but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast.

488,"Yes - in some cases. First, overlap between sites is fine. It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law. I do agree that, so far, the legal questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in a comment I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites. Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making. We have the same situation here. Some legal questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project. That's not to say that all legal questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow legal questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet.",ai,avp,beer
489,"Yes! Absolutely. We need to reward good answers, and raise rep levels so suers can get moderation privileges when they rise to the normal public beta levels.

What happened to me yesterday: I'm grateful to the downvoter, and to the comments. We need to establish what posts are good and bad in the site, and my original answer was not good. It was wrong in several points - and since the question was about safety, it was even more important for it to be correct. The feedback helped me to fix my answer, but if I had not done so, the downvote would have ensured that better answers went to the top. We should definitely upvote. But downvoting is good, too.
